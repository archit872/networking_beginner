      <h1>IP Addressing, Subnetting &amp; Routing Basics</h1>
      <p class="abstract">
        This chapter makes addressing and routing feel natural. You’ll learn to read and pick <abbr title="Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation, e.g., 10.0.0.0/24">CIDR</abbr> blocks, identify the <strong><abbr title="A logical partition of an IP network">subnet</abbr></strong> from an address and mask, and reason about how packets choose a <strong><abbr title="The next router a host uses to reach networks beyond its own subnet">default gateway</abbr></strong>. We’ll tie concepts to everyday developer tasks like configuring containers, cloud VPCs, and home routers.

    <!-- IP Addressing -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 id="ip-addressing">1) IP Addressing</h2>
      <p>
        An IPv4 address is 32 bits, typically written as four decimal octets: <code>a.b.c.d</code>. A <strong><abbr title="Network mask indicating which bits identify the network versus host">subnet mask</abbr></strong> (e.g., <code>255.255.255.0</code>) or a <strong><abbr title="CIDR indicates the number of leading 1-bits in the mask, e.g., /24">CIDR prefix</abbr></strong> (e.g., <code>/24</code>) tells you which bits identify the network and which identify the host.
      </p>

      <h3 id="private-ranges">Private addressing &amp; NAT</h3>
      <p>
        Many environments use private ranges that are not routed on the public Internet: <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>. A <strong><abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr></strong> gateway maps many private hosts to a public <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>, rewriting addresses and ports. This allows home networks and clouds to scale internal addressing without consuming public space.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ipv6-intro">IPv6 intro</h3>
      <p>
        IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses written in hexadecimal (e.g., <code>2001:db8::1</code>). It expands address space dramatically and changes some mechanisms (e.g., Neighbor Discovery replaces <abbr title="Address Resolution Protocol">ARP</abbr>). You’ll encounter <abbr title="Stateless Address Autoconfiguration">SLAAC</abbr>, <abbr title="Unique Local Addressing">ULA</abbr> ranges (like <code>fd00::/8</code>), and dual-stack hosts running both IPv4 and IPv6. The routing and subnetting logic—prefix length, next hop—remains conceptually the same.
      </p>

      <div class="callout info">
        <strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of a city address: the street and area are the “network” bits; the house number is the “host” bits. A larger neighborhood plan (/16 vs /24) means more houses fit before you need a new street (new subnet).
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Subnetting Simplified -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 id="subnetting">2) Subnetting Simplified</h2>
      <p>
        Subnetting slices a larger network into smaller ones. In CIDR, <code>/n</code> means “the first <em>n</em> bits are the network.” The number of usable hosts in an IPv4 subnet is approximately <code>2^(host-bits) - 2</code> (network and broadcast addresses are reserved).
      </p>

      <h3 id="quick-rules">Quick rules &amp; mental math</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>/24</strong> → 256 addresses → 254 usable hosts (<code>192.168.1.0–192.168.1.255</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>/23</strong> → 512 addresses → 510 usable hosts (two /24s combined).</li>
        <li><strong>/20</strong> → 4096 addresses → 4094 usable (good for a small VPC).</li>
        <li><strong>/30</strong> → 4 addresses → 2 usable (point-to-point links).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="example-1">Example 1: Find the network and broadcast</h3>
      <p>
        Given <code>10.2.5.77/24</code>, the network is <code>10.2.5.0</code> and the broadcast is <code>10.2.5.255</code>. Usable range: <code>10.2.5.1–10.2.5.254</code>. Reason: a <code>/24</code> keeps the first three octets (<code>10.2.5</code>) as the network.
      </p>

      <h3 id="example-2">Example 2: Carving subnets for services</h3>
      <p>
        You own <code>10.0.0.0/20</code> for a dev VPC. You want separate nets for <em>web</em>, <em>db</em>, and <em>shared</em>. Splitting into four <code>/22</code> subnets yields:
      </p>
      <pre data-lang="calc"><code>
10.0.0.0/22   (web)     → 10.0.0.1–10.0.3.254
10.0.4.0/22   (db)      → 10.0.4.1–10.0.7.254
10.0.8.0/22   (shared)  → 10.0.8.1–10.0.11.254
10.0.12.0/22  (reserve) → future expansion
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Each /22 holds ~1022 hosts—plenty for autoscaling groups while keeping route tables small and predictable.
      </p>

      <div class="callout warn">
        <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Larger subnets simplify routing and growth but enlarge broadcast domains and failure blast radius. Smaller subnets isolate services and reduce noise, but you’ll manage more routes and risk running out of addresses sooner.
      </div>

      <h3 id="vlsm">Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)</h3>
      <p>
        Real networks rarely split evenly. With <strong><abbr title="Variable Length Subnet Masking">VLSM</abbr></strong>, you allocate bigger subnets where needed (e.g., /23 for a large web tier) and smaller ones elsewhere (/26 for admin). The only rule: subnets must not overlap.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Routing Fundamentals -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 id="routing">3) Routing Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>
        Routing is the process of choosing where to send a packet next. Hosts and routers consult a <strong><abbr title="Table of destination prefixes and their next hops">routing table</abbr></strong>. The key rule is <strong>longest-prefix match</strong>: the route with the most specific prefix (largest <code>/n</code>) that matches the destination address wins.
      </p>

      <h3 id="default-gw">Default gateways</h3>
      <p>
        When no specific route matches, the host sends the packet to its default gateway (often the home router or VPC edge). The host must first resolve the gateway’s IP to a <strong><abbr title="Layer 2 address used on local segments">MAC address</abbr></strong> using <abbr title="Address Resolution Protocol">ARP</abbr> (IPv4) or Neighbor Discovery (IPv6).
      </p>

      <h3 id="compare-routing">Compare &amp; Contrast: Static vs Dynamic routing</h3>
      <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Static Routes</th><th>Dynamic Routing</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Setup</td><td>Manually configured on hosts/routers</td><td>Learned via protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Scalability</td><td>Good for small, stable nets</td><td>Handles growth and changes automatically</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Convergence</td><td>No automatic failover</td><td>Recomputes paths after link/node failures</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Complexity</td><td>Low</td><td>Higher; needs policy and tuning</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3 id="example-route">Example: Which route wins?</h3>
      <p>
        Destination <code>10.1.2.3</code> with these routes:
      </p>
      <pre data-lang="routes"><code>
10.1.0.0/16 via 10.0.0.1
10.1.2.0/24 via 10.0.0.2
0.0.0.0/0   via 192.168.1.1
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The <code>/24</code> is most specific, so traffic goes via <code>10.0.0.2</code>. If that route disappeared, the <code>/16</code> would take over; absent both, the default route would handle it.
      </p>

      <div class="callout success">
        <strong>Developer tip:</strong> On Linux, use <span class="kbd">ip route</span> or <span class="kbd">ip -6 route</span> to view tables; <span class="kbd">ip route get &lt;dest&gt;</span> asks the kernel which route it would use—great for sanity checks.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Case Study -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 id="case-study">Case Study (~200 words): The phantom timeouts</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          A team noticed intermittent timeouts to a cache cluster at <code>10.20.5.25</code>. Pings worked from some nodes but not others. Application logs showed retries, and <code>traceroute</code> stalled after the first hop on failing nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing <span class="kbd">ip route</span> outputs revealed two route entries: a broad <code>10.20.0.0/16</code> via <code>10.20.0.1</code> (old) and a specific <code>10.20.5.0/24</code> via <code>10.20.4.1</code> (new). On healthy nodes, the /24 existed and traffic flowed; on failing nodes, a stale configuration management template had omitted the /24. Because of longest-prefix match, the presence or absence of the /24 entirely determined reachability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fix was simple—roll out the /24 route consistently—but the lesson stuck: when a target is reachable from one host and not another on the same network, compare routing tables first. Small differences in prefix length can produce big differences in behavior.
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary>1) Define network, broadcast, and usable host range for 172.16.4.19/20.</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> /20 → block size 16 in the third octet (<code>172.16.0.0–172.16.15.255</code>). Network: <code>172.16.0.0</code>; broadcast: <code>172.16.15.255</code>; usable: <code>172.16.0.1–172.16.15.254</code>.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Why does a /24 route beat a /16 route?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Longest-prefix match picks the most specific prefix that matches the destination; /24 has more fixed bits than /16, so it wins.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) How does a host send to an off-subnet destination?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It ARPs for the default gateway’s MAC and sends the frame to that gateway; the gateway routes the packet onward based on its own routing table.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Contrast IPv4 ARP with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> ARP broadcasts “who has &lt;IP&gt;?” to learn a MAC (IPv4, Layer 2). Neighbor Discovery uses ICMPv6 messages (solicitations/advertisements) and multicast to discover neighbors and routers (IPv6).</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) What problem does NAT solve, and what are two side effects?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> NAT conserves public addresses and hides internal topology. Side effects: breaks inbound reachability by default and can complicate protocols that embed IPs/ports (requires ALGs or app awareness).</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Given 10.0.8.25/21, what’s the network and how many usable hosts?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> /21 → block size 8 in the third octet: networks at 10.0.0.0, 10.0.8.0, 10.0.16.0… So network is <code>10.0.8.0</code>. Host bits = 11 → <code>2^11 - 2 = 2046</code> usable hosts.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Why might two containers on the same host fail to talk despite unique IPs?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Overlapping subnets between container bridges or a missing route/NAT rule; longest-prefix match may steer traffic to the wrong interface or drop due to policy.</p>
