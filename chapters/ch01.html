      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>None — this chapter assumes you’re starting from scratch. If you know how to run a program and open a website, you have all the context you need.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand why networking is essential for software engineers.</li>
        <li>Learn the history and goals of computer networking.</li>
        <li>Recognize the role of networking in modern software systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1. What is Networking?</h2>
      <p>At its core, networking is about <strong>communication</strong> between machines. Imagine a <abbr title="Analogy for how computers exchange data">post office</abbr> that delivers messages: your program writes a letter, the network delivers it, and another program reads it. This analogy helps us see networking as structured, rule-bound, and reliable—until things break down.</p>
      <p>Networking is everywhere: checking email, syncing code, streaming music, or deploying services. Each action triggers a cascade of protocols and packets behind the scenes.</p>

        <figcaption>A post office delivers envelopes; a network delivers packets. Both rely on rules and addresses.</figcaption>

      <h2>2. Networking in Software Development</h2>
      <p>For developers, networking appears in <strong>client-server</strong> and <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> systems. When your code calls an API, it becomes a client. When you host a service, you’re the server. Peer-to-peer models (like file sharing) let every node act as both client and server.</p>
      <p>Distributed systems like microservices, chat apps, or multiplayer games all depend on robust networking. Understanding how requests flow makes debugging faster and design decisions clearer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. The Evolution of Networks</h2>
      <p>Networking has evolved from <abbr title="ARPANET: Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr> to today’s global Internet. Early networks connected a few university computers. Now, billions of devices—wired and wireless—communicate constantly.</p>
      <p>Wireless access points extend networks beyond cables, trading stability for convenience. Wired connections offer speed and predictability; wireless enables mobility. Engineers must often weigh this <strong>trade-off</strong> depending on application needs.</p>

      <div class="callout warn">
        <strong>Trade-off:</strong> Wired networks offer higher throughput and lower interference, but limit mobility. Wireless enables access anywhere, but suffers from interference, coverage gaps, and fluctuating speeds.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Case Study: Debugging a Slow Build</h2>
      <p>At a mid-sized software company, developers noticed their builds took twice as long when working from home. Logs showed dependency downloads failing intermittently. After investigation, the culprit was a flaky home Wi-Fi connection that dropped packets. Developers switched to wired Ethernet and immediately saw stable, faster builds.</p>
      <p>This case highlights how network conditions directly impact developer productivity. Without understanding networking basics, the team might have blamed build tools or CI systems instead of their home network.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Analogy: Roads and Vehicles</h2>
      <p>Think of networks like <strong>roads</strong> and data like <strong>vehicles</strong>. Bandwidth is lane width, latency is the time vehicles spend waiting at traffic lights, and protocols are traffic laws. Just as efficient roads enable commerce, efficient networks enable digital services.</p>

    <section class="card practice">
      <h2>Practice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketch a diagram showing how your computer connects to a website. Label client, server, and network components. (15 min)</li>
        <li>Identify three everyday activities (e.g., video call, file upload, game streaming) and note how networking enables them. (10 min)</li>
        <li>Compare wired and wireless connections in your environment—where do you use each, and why? (15 min)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mastery Check</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Why is networking essential for software engineers?</li>
        <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Because most modern software is distributed: APIs, cloud services, and integrations depend on network flows. Without understanding networking, debugging and design decisions become guesswork.</p></details>

        <li>Give one historical milestone in the evolution of networks.</li>
        <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>ARPANET in the late 1960s, which demonstrated packet switching and laid the foundation for today’s Internet.</p></details>

        <li>Explain the client-server vs peer-to-peer difference with an example.</li>
        <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Client-server: a mobile app requests data from a central API. Peer-to-peer: BitTorrent, where each participant uploads and downloads pieces of a file to/from others.</p></details>

        <li>What is a trade-off between wired and wireless networking?</li>
        <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Wired offers speed and reliability but limits mobility. Wireless offers mobility but has interference and variable speed.</p></details>

        <li>Use the road/vehicle analogy: What do bandwidth and latency represent?</li>
        <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Bandwidth = road/lane width (how much traffic can pass). Latency = delays like traffic lights (how long vehicles wait before moving).</p></details>
      </ol>

      <h2>Recap & Next Steps</h2>
      <p>You’ve seen that networking is not abstract—it underpins every action in software development. You learned what networking is, where it shows up in development, and how it evolved. In the next chapter, we’ll build your core vocabulary: packets, protocols, bandwidth, latency, and how they work together.</p>
