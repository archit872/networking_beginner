    <!-- Data Transmission Basics -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 id="transmission-basics">1) Data Transmission Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Everything starts with <strong><abbr title="Binary digits: 0 or 1">bits</abbr></strong>. On a wire, those bits become changes in voltage; in fiber, changes in light; and in wireless, changes in radio waves. The method of turning bits into physical changes is called <strong><abbr title="Mapping digital data into a signal suitable for transmission">encoding</abbr></strong> or modulation. Devices agree on timing (<em>clocking</em>) so a receiver knows when to sample the signal.
      </p>
      <h3 id="signals-encoding">Bits, signals, and encoding</h3>
      <p>
        A simple scheme like <em>NRZ</em> (non-return-to-zero) maps 1s and 0s to two voltage levels. More advanced schemes pack more information per unit time or better resist noise. Regardless of the scheme, links have limits: noise, attenuation, and interference constrain how fast and how far we can send data without errors.
      </p>
      <h3 id="bw-latency">Bandwidth &amp; latency (analogy + pitfalls)</h3>
      <p>
        Think of a highway: <strong>bandwidth</strong> is the number of lanes (how much can flow at once); <strong>latency</strong> is the travel time for a single car. Adding lanes (bandwidth) doesn’t shorten the distance or the speed limit (latency). A common pitfall is to think “I upgraded to faster Wi-Fi so my API should respond quicker”; higher bandwidth can help <em>throughput</em> under load, but the round-trip time to the server is still influenced by distance, routing, and contention.
      </p>
      <div class="callout info">
        <span class="icon">ℹ️</span>
        <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Bandwidth sets your ceiling; latency sets your snappiness. Apps that send small requests (APIs, auth, RPC) feel latency more than bandwidth. Bulk transfers (backups, video) care more about throughput, which depends on both bandwidth and loss.
      </div>

        <img src="../assets/signal-frame-packet.svg" alt="Layered diagram showing signals at the physical layer, frames at the data link layer, and packets at the network layer with headers and payloads">
        <figcaption>
          Signals carry <em>frames</em>; frames carry <em>packets</em>; packets carry <em>segments</em> or datagrams; those carry application data. Each layer adds headers (envelopes) to direct traffic and detect errors.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <!-- Packets & Protocols -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 id="packets-protocols">2) Packets &amp; Protocols</h2>
      <p>
        Networks scale by chopping data into <strong><abbr title="Formatted units of data carried by a network">packets</abbr></strong>. Each packet is wrapped with headers that hold addressing and control information. This wrapping is called <strong><abbr title="The process of adding headers and trailers at each layer">encapsulation</abbr></strong>. At the receiving end, the process runs in reverse—<em>decapsulation</em>—to reveal the original data.
      </p>
      <h3 id="nested-envelopes">Encapsulation: nested envelopes</h3>
      <p>
        Picture a set of nested envelopes: an <em>application</em> letter goes into a transport envelope (TCP/UDP), which goes into a <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> envelope, which then goes into a link-layer envelope (Ethernet/Wi-Fi). Each envelope has its own addressing and checks. Intermediate devices only need to read the layers they understand: a <strong><abbr title="Layer 2 device that forwards frames">switch</abbr></strong> routes by link-layer addresses (MAC), while a <strong><abbr title="Layer 3 device that forwards packets between networks">router</abbr></strong> routes by IP.
      </p>
      <h3 id="protocol-roles">Protocol roles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Link layer:</strong> moves <em>frames</em> on the local network; uses <strong><abbr title="Media Access Control">MAC</abbr></strong> addresses; detects errors with checksums.</li>
        <li><strong>Network layer (IP):</strong> moves <em>packets</em> between networks; uses <strong><abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr></strong> addresses; finds next hops with routing tables.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport layer:</strong> moves app messages reliably (<strong><abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr></strong>) or quickly with no connection (<strong><abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr></strong>).</li>
        <li><strong>Application layer:</strong> defines semantics like HTTP requests, DNS queries, SMTP emails.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout warn">
        <strong>Trade-off:</strong> More reliability at lower layers (e.g., heavy link-layer retries) can <em>increase</em> latency and jitter, which may hurt real-time apps. Conversely, pushing everything to the application layer can reinvent wheels and fragment behavior. Choose where to place reliability deliberately.
      </div>

      <h3 id="example-encap">Example 1: Debugging a missing response</h3>
      <p>
        Your service sends an HTTP request but never sees a reply. A packet capture reveals outgoing TCP SYNs, SYN-ACK returns, the request payload, then… nothing. A firewall drops the server’s response because it exceeds a size threshold when an extra header is added. Knowing how headers inflate packets leads you to adjust the gateway policy rather than rewriting the client.
      </p>

      <h3 id="example-mtu">Example 2: MTU and fragmentation</h3>
      <p>
        A download stalls only on a specific VPN. <abbr title="Maximum Transmission Unit">MTU</abbr> on the tunnel is smaller than on the path, so large packets fragment or get dropped due to “Don’t Fragment” flags. Lowering the client’s MTU or enabling <abbr title="Path MTU Discovery">PMTUD</abbr> resolves the issue. Lesson: packet size limits are real, especially across heterogeneous links.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Local Networks -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2 id="local-networks">3) Local Networks: Ethernet &amp; Wi-Fi, Switches &amp; Access Points</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong><abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr></strong> connects devices in a home, office, or data center. On Ethernet, devices plug into switches; on Wi-Fi, they associate with access points (APs) that bridge wireless frames to the wired network. The link layer uses <strong><abbr title="Unique hardware identifier used on a local network">MAC addresses</abbr></strong> to deliver frames on the local segment.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ethernet">Ethernet basics</h3>
      <p>
        Ethernet frames include source/destination MACs, an <abbr title="VLAN identifier used to separate broadcast domains logically">802.1Q VLAN tag</abbr> (optional), a type/length field, payload, and a frame check sequence (FCS). Switches learn which MAC lives on which port and forward frames accordingly, reducing unnecessary traffic.
      </p>

      <h3 id="wifi">Wi-Fi basics</h3>
      <p>
        Wi-Fi trades wire reliability for mobility. Radios share spectrum using contention (CSMA/CA), so throughput varies with interference and client density. APs advertise <abbr title="Service Set Identifier">SSID</abbr>s; clients authenticate and associate, then exchange frames just like Ethernet—only over the air. Signal strength, channel width, and band (2.4 vs 5/6 GHz) materially affect performance.
      </p>

      <h3 id="switches-aps">Switches &amp; access points</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>switch</strong> is a multi-port bridge that operates at Layer 2, while an <strong>access point</strong> is a Layer-2 device for wireless that often includes controller logic and bridge functions. Many “home routers” bundle an AP, a switch, a router, <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr>, and a <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> server in one box.

        <strong>Developer tip:</strong> If a bug “only happens on Wi-Fi”, try reproducing on wired Ethernet. If it disappears, you’re likely dealing with jitter, loss, or power-saving behavior on the wireless link—not your application logic.

      <div class="title">Mastery Check <span class="badge">Self-review</span></div>

      <details>
        <summary>1) Define bandwidth, latency, and throughput; give one pitfall for interpreting them.</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bandwidth is capacity per unit time; latency is one-way or round-trip delay; throughput is actual delivered data per unit time. Pitfall: assuming bandwidth upgrades reduce latency; they usually don’t if distance/routing dominate.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) What is encapsulation and why is it useful?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Encapsulation is wrapping data with headers at successive layers (transport, network, link). It lets each layer solve its own concerns (reliability, addressing, medium access) and allows intermediate devices to forward using only the headers they understand.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Contrast a switch and a router in one sentence each.</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A switch forwards frames within a LAN using MAC addresses (Layer 2), while a router forwards packets between networks using IP addresses (Layer 3).</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Why can Wi-Fi show good bandwidth but poor application responsiveness?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Contention, retries, and power-saving can raise latency and jitter even if peak throughput is high, making small interactive requests feel slow.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) How does MTU affect application behavior?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> If packets exceed the path’s MTU they fragment or drop; this can stall connections (e.g., path MTU black holes). Tuning MTU or enabling path MTU discovery prevents stalls.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Which layer detects bit errors on a LAN and how?</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The link layer (e.g., Ethernet) using a frame check sequence (CRC). Corrupted frames are discarded and typically retried by higher layers or link-specific mechanisms.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Give a real-world example where knowing TCP vs UDP matters.</summary>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> For a telemetry pipeline, UDP avoids head-of-line blocking and tolerates some loss; for payments, TCP’s reliability and ordering are essential to ensure integrity.</p>
