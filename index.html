      <p class="abstract">
        This practical, developer-first book builds your networking intuition from the ground up. You’ll learn the language of networks, how the <abbr title="Open Systems Interconnection">OSI</abbr> and TCP/IP models map to real software, and how to wield tools like <code>ping</code>, <code>traceroute</code>, <code>nslookup</code>, and Wireshark. Along the way you’ll practice with realistic tasks and complete a guided mini-project to set up and debug a small network.

      <h2>How to Use This Book</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need prior networking experience—just basic programming comfort. Each chapter opens with clear objectives and ends with practice and a mastery check. Skim the chapter overview first, then read linearly. When you see a callout, slow down: it often highlights a common pitfall or a trade-off that matters in real engineering work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The curriculum takes a “concept → workflow → hands-on” approach. Early chapters give you vocabulary and mental models; middle chapters connect those ideas to everyday developer tasks; later chapters guide you through building and debugging a mini network. If you’re short on time, read the introductions and summaries, then do the Practice sections—these are intentionally scoped and time-boxed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep your terminal open as you read. Many examples use cross-platform tools available on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Try the commands on your own machine and compare outputs. For deeper dives, consult the Resources at the end of each chapter; they were chosen for clarity and practical value.
      </p>
      <div class="callout info">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Create a notes file. For each new term (e.g., <em>packet</em>, <em>latency</em>, <em>gateway</em>), write a plain definition, a formal definition, a pitfall, and an example. This mirrors how the Glossary is structured and accelerates retention.
