      <h1>Networking for Software Engineers (Beginner)</h1>
      <p class="muted">Audience: software engineers with basic programming knowledge and little to no formal networking background. Goal: build the vocabulary, mental models, and workflows needed to debug, design, and integrate networked software with confidence.</p>

      <h2>Why this book</h2>
      <p>
        Your code doesn’t run in a vacuum—it rides a network of cables, radios, switches, and protocols.
        Understanding how requests travel, how failures surface, and how tools expose what’s really happening
        is the difference between guessing and engineering. This book gives you a strong foundation without drowning
        you in vendor-specific detail. You’ll learn how to explain <em>why</em> packets move the way they do, and how to
        fix issues when they don’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take a pragmatic, developer-first approach: clear explanations, precise terminology, visual figures,
        hands-on tasks, and step-by-step workflows. Each chapter ends with practice tasks and a mastery check
        (with sample answers hidden in <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>) so you can verify your understanding immediately.

        <h2>How to use this book</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Read actively.</strong> Translate new terms into your own words. Use the <span class="pill">Glossary</span> liberally.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice immediately.</strong> After each chapter, do the short exercises—treat them like you treat unit tests.</li>
          <li><strong>Debug out loud.</strong> Use the provided workflows (ping → DNS → traceroute → curl → logs) to reason, not just try things.</li>
          <li><strong>Build the project.</strong> Chapter 7 guides you through a mini network, reinforcing models, IPs, routing, and tooling.</li>
          <li><strong>Reflect.</strong> Chapter 8 consolidates pitfalls, best practices, and next steps so you can plan your learning path.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>What you’ll need</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A laptop with terminal access (macOS, Linux, or Windows with PowerShell).</li>
          <li>Ability to install basic tools (Wireshark, curl) and optional simulators (Docker, Packet Tracer).</li>
          <li>Comfort writing and running simple commands.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re on a locked-down machine, you can still follow along with most CLI workflows and visualizations.

      <h2>Progression & Outcomes</h2>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <h3>Beginner End Goal</h3>
          <p>Understand core vocabulary (packet, protocol, latency), the OSI/TCP/IP models, IP addressing/subnetting basics, and how to use essential tools. You’ll be able to diagram flows, identify where things break, and communicate clearly with ops and SRE teammates.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>With fundamentals in place, you can move into intermediate topics: advanced routing (e.g., BGP), TLS and PKI, cloud and container networking, service meshes, and performance tuning.</p>
